# Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG)
  
## Algorithm
For this project, the _ddpg-pendulum_ algorithm provided by Udacity was adapted to train the 20 agent enviroment.   
The [DDPG](https://spinningup.openai.com/en/latest/algorithms/ddpg.html#id1) algorithm is an policy based method that implements and actor-critic archicteture.  

The pseudocode is [described](https://spinningup.openai.com/en/latest/algorithms/ddpg.html#pseudocode) as follows:
